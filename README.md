### Wishlist

- Background Notification for users.

#### Testing

Scanning Beacon Takes only a split second. that means the attendance is really fast. though I don't know about the speed of data that is being transfered.
As long as I get the **Realtime Updates** from the Firestore and **Offline Support** from Firebase.
